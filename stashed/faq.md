Frequently Asked Questions


**Cfx.re/FiveM Status** https://status.cfx.re/ <!-- new line "\" -->\
**Common Game Issues** https://docs.fivem.net/docs/support/client-issues/

**? -** *The server you are joining does not allow modified game files.*\
We block all modified client files except [audio files](https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/audio/?sortby=file_downloads) and some known [graphics mods](https://www.patreon.com/razedmods).

**? -** *You have been banned from this server.*\
Bans are manually triggered by Moderators or Game Admins when it is found that some form of rule breaking has occurred. There is no way to appeal this decision, you must wait it out. Further discussion in regards to bans in our Discord may result in removal or timeout.

**? -** I have UI or interface lag, how do I fix it?\
Open your **FiveM Settings** in the top right homepage, find **Game** and enable **NUI in-process GPU** ![NUI in-process GPU](https://i.imgur.com/dsnIQWV.png).
