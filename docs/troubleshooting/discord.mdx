Knowledgebase on troubleshooting Discord and Cfx.re account connections.

## _You are required to join our Discord Guild to connect_ {#discord-required}

1. Ensure you've joined our [Discord Guild](https://backlotgames.com/discord) (backlotgames.com/discord).
2. Make sure your Discord and Cfx.re/FiveM accounts are fully linked - [read below](#discord-identifier).

## _Missing Discord Identifier_ {#discord-identifier}

1. Exit the FiveM app.
2. Fully close Discord (follow screenshots).

   <img class="closeDiscord" src={closeDiscordOne} />
   <img class="closeDiscord" src={closeDiscordTwo} />
3. Reopen your Discord Desktop Client (not the web browser and **do not** run as an administrator).
4. Ensure you are logged into the correct Discord account you wish to connect.
5. Start your FiveM application and let it fully load to the homepage.
6. Return to Discord and accept the connect prompt (seen below).

### Further issues

If you're unsure if Discord has connected, open FiveM and click into Settings in the top right. You will see a "Link identities" section where the Discord logo should show your username next to it. If you still cannot connect, try restarting your entire computer. Don't run Discord as an administrator.
