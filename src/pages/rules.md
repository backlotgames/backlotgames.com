# Server Rules
We utilizes rules, *a set of explicit regulations or principles governing conduct within a particular activity*, as means to regulate roleplay for the best possible player experience. When rules are updated, they will be noted in the [changelog](https://backlotgames.com/updates).

### **Prerequisites**
- Working microphone of decent audible quality.
- You & your characters must be 18+ years of age.
- Roleplay must follow [TwitchTV](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/) and [FiveM](https://fivem.net/terms) Terms of Service.
- Absolutely no sexual, racist or other hateful remarks; in or out of character.

### **General Rules** {#general}
#### 1. Metagaming {#1}
Use of information in-game that was obtained Out of Character. This includes, but is not limited to, stream-sniping, using 3rd party communication platforms or use of information gained from another one of your characters.
#### 2. Breaking Character {#2}
Roleplay is acting, breaking the act is not roleplay. No matter the situation, even when another character is breaking rules or there's a bug, attempt to stay in character.
#### 3. Powergaming {#3}
Unrealistic RP (superhuman, driving while cuffed, etc), abusing in-game mechanics and identifying someone by their voice without seeing the characters face.
#### 4. New Life {#4}
When killed, which is respawning or fully dying at the hospital, don't remember details of the situation. You are allowed to recall events if revived on the scene by medics.
#### 5. No Value of Life {#5}
Self explanatory. For example, someone is holding you at gunpoint, drawing your weapon in most situations is NVL. Pleas no suicide related RP.
#### 6. Medic RP {#6}
Medical members are neutral parties and cannot be attacked (robbery, kidnapping, stealing their vehicles, etc). Does not apply when they are off duty. If you are revived, you cannot re-initiate the scene. Please RP with Medical members while they are treating or reviving you.
#### 7. Sheriff RP {#7}
Sheriff members may not be corrupt and cannot give away items gained from their job. There cannot be more than eight Sheriff members on one scene at at time. If a Sheriff member is downed or killed, another cannot take their place, which means they still count towards the eight max. **Non Sheriff members may not use holsters in their clothing or attire**.
#### 8. Combat Logging {#8}
Logging off to: get away from Sheriffs, not lose items or inventory, or when in a ongoing RP scene.
#### 9. Exploits/Hacked Clients {#9}
Any form of cheating or exploiting is a permanently bannable offense.
#### 10. Trolling {#10}
You will be permanently banned if found malicious.

### **Roleplay Rules** {#roleplay}
#### 11. Initiation of Combat {#11}
Must have a moderate level of effort beforehand. Players must note audible and visible threats of harm, and allow reaction time for other parties.
#### 12. Gang RP {#12}
Claiming of areas or blocks is allowed, but restricting said areas to your gang only is not (sometimes includes 'taxing'). Combat between two gangs is also allowed but requires a moderate amount of RP beforehand - **we are not a gunplay community**. No more than 12 members in a single gang. Gang leaders can request a Discord status or role if the max limit is reached.
#### 13. RDM/VDM {#13}
Random/Vehicle Death Match is a player killing or attempting to kill another with little to no prior RP (this is absolutely not accepted). Players may use a vehicle in self defense with proper RP beforehand. This is dependent case by case.
#### 14. Fail RP {#14}
We're a Serious Roleplay community which means all RP must be as realistic as possible, even if game physics hinder it. Some examples:
 - Having a very bad vehicle accident, immediately getting out and running away.
 - Getting shot or downed, revived and then immediately running away from the scene.
 - Falling off a skyscraper, being revived and then fleeing the scene on foot (*your legs are fucked!*).
#### 15. Low Effort RP {#15}
Like Rule 14, this is applicable in most scenarios. Some examples:
 - Reduce habitually being a violent criminal or character.
 - Using an NPC as a hostage or killing one for no real reason.
 - Fleeing from Sheriffs every chance you get no matter the RP.
 - Storing or retrieving personal or gang vehicles during a chase.
 - Using fake characters (friends, gang members, etc) as hostages.
 - Entering apartments or houses during while in a Sheriff or gang chase.
 - Avoid camping main criminal or gang locations without recent prior RP.
 - Baiting Sheriffs such as intentionally committing a crime in front of them for taunting purposes.
 - **Pocket Wiping** Removing all items from another players inventory when robbing or while they are downed. You may take whatever is in the first two inventory lines with proper prior RP. Unrealistic taking of items is still not allowed (ex: you downed another player in a gun fight, but were shot and seriously injured, yet proceed to take their items instead of retreating like in real life).
#### 16. Restricted RP {#16}
Like Rule 14 & 15, this is applicable in most scenarios. Some examples:
 - ERP (Erotic or Sexual Roleplay - *you are weird!*).
 - Suicide, Domestic Violence, Rape and Terrorism (self explanatory, not cool).
  
### **Misc/Other** {#other}
- Use respectful soundboards or avoid them all together.
- Robbing another player requires at least four Sheriffs on duty.
- Robbing a Sheriff member requires at least six Sheriffs on duty.
- Having multiple characters in the same 'clique' is never allowed.
- Avoid inserting yourself into other roleplay scenarios if malicious.
- No character relations, such as "my brother/cousin is flying in soon".
- 'Body Cam' or Twitch/YT recordings cannot be used unless your character was actually using a physical item to record (i.e., Sheriff bodycam on ped, phone, CCTV, etc).
